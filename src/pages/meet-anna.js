        Anna decided to pursue a career as a Health Coach so she could help
        people establish balance and fulfill their purpose by living healthier,
        more passionate lives. There are many different things calling for
        attention in day-to-day life that take away from one’s purpose and
        happiness, but Anna has found a way to establish balance despite these
        daily challenges and created a program through which her clients have
        found tremendous success. Anna’s coaching pattern has helped clients
        achieve weight loss, overcome depression, reduce cravings, diminish
        stress and more.

        The program focuses on creating balance and helping people take control
        of their lives through mindful living. Anna helps participants leave the
        frustrating and time-consuming body, food and mind battles in the past.
        Instead of lists of restrictions and obsessions over calories, she has
        created a fun, flexible and rewarding program where lasting change
        happens and goals are achieved.
